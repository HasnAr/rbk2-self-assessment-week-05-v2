## ngFizzBuzz
Play fizzbuzz (and fozzbazz!) with Angular
  * [Mostly complete    ] Implement a counter as a service or factory
  * [Mostly complete    ] Initialize your counter with a value of 0
  * [ Mostly complete   ] Increment your counter by 1 every time it is clicked in either view
  * [ Mostly complete   ] The counter's value should be the same in both views, though display slightly differently depending on which view is being rendered as per the following logic:

## In the Fizzbuzz controller:
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by three, display FIZZ
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by five, display BUZZ
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by both, display FIZZBUZZ

## In the Fozzbazz controller:
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by four, display FOZZ
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by six, display BAZZ
  * [ Mostly complete   ] If the counter is divisible by both, display FOZZBAZZ

Angular requires you serve your code from a web server, not directly from the file-system. One simple way to do this is with the npm package, [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).

Install live-server with `npm install -g live-server`, then run `live-server` from the directory where your code is. Going to the url the program's output gives you will open your files in the browser from the local node web server.

The best part of `live-server` is that it will automatically refresh the page when any files in the served directory change!
